# Evil_Hangman

The game of hangman is played by a player choosing a word and having other guess letters/word until the chosen word is revealed.

An evil hangman implementation of the game is done by having the chosen word switched upon player guesses to prevent the players from correctly guessing the word (assuming a fair amount of guesses).

This project implements the evil hangman algorithm into the game of hangman, using AVL trees, and vectors.

This is a semester long project done at the University of Massachusetts Lowell in COMP1020 - Computing II.
